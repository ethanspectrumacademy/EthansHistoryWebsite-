<h1>The earth path to life.</h1>
<p>The foundation of the story is the earth itself. Changes recorded in fossils of flora and fauna, and geographical forms tell the story lasting hunderds of millions of years The shape of the world changed many times. Rifts opened and closed in its surface, coasts rose and fell. At times huge areas of land were coverd with vegetation. Many plants and animals emerged and died. However those events of death happended with unimaginable slowness. Some lasting million of years and the most rapid extinctions took centures.

<br>Climate was the first pacemaker of change. About 65 milllion years ago a long warm climatic phase began to to end. It had favoured reptiles and during this time, Antarctica had separated from Australia. there were no ice fields in any part of the world at this time As the world became more and more cold, new climatic conditions emerged. These conditions led to the extinction of the dinosaurs alongside with a likely meteorite inpact. The new conditions were better suited for non-reptilie animals already about. Among them same mammals whose ancestors had appeared two houndred million years earlier. They now rome the earth and  eventually became todays mammals including us human.
