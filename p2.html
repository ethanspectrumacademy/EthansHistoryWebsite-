<h2>Our ancestors.</h2>
<p> to put it short, our history begeins with the development of hominids around 7 million years ago. The first homind being the Australopithecus afarensis also know as the "Southern Ape". they was around 3 feet tail and had 1/3 of the brain power of humans.
they also look more apelike then human but were biped. Around 1.5 to 2 million years ago the Homo habillis appeared. They were also biped and were around 4 to 5 feet tail. they had the brain power of 2/3 of humans today. They made simple stone tools and hunted in groups to increasee success rates of geting a meal. .   </p>
